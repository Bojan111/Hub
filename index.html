		<hr />
		<h3>Blockchain technology is a digital ledger that records<br /> value creation in a transparent, democratic and safe<br /> way.</h3>
		<p>This creates a trustworthy and traceable record of transactions, which<br /> covers areas such as the Financial sector (Cryptocurencies), the Supply<br /> chain, the Energy and Different utilities sector, Governance and Public<br /> services, as well as the designing of new business models.</p>

			Blockchain, as the name suggests, represents a series of blocks containing data, linked together in a linear chronological order in a continuously expanding chain.
			It is made in such a way that the data contained in each block is dependent on the block before it, meaning that any accidental or malicious change of data in one block would make all of the blocks invalid, essentially making the data immutable (tamper-proof) once entered.
			We can view the blockchain as a shared and decentralized database, the decentralization is achieved in such a way that each client that has access to the database has their own copy of said database. There is no third party hosting the data.
		</p>
		<p class="sec">Security and trust are maintained by a distributed consensus algorithm. Essentially, for any change in the data to be implemented, all clients must agree upon it. No one party can unintentionally (through user error) or deliberately alter the data in the database without the consent of all other parties involved. All of these characteristics combined make blockchain a perfect candidate for a secure and distributed ledger that can be used to store records of extremely high value and/or importance, such as records of transactions(cryptocurrencies), records of shipments (supply chain), records of a customer’s power usage (energy sector), medical records (healthcare), records of real estate ownership (public sector) and many more.</p>
